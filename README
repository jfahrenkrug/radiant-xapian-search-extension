= Sphinx Search

Adds ThinkingSphinx [http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/] support to Radiant.

== Usage

After installation, you'll need to load the Thinking Sphinx submodule via:
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

By default, only the first 8kB of any page's content will be indexed. You can 
change this in page_extensions.rb if that's not enough space, or if you wish
to reduce that in order to keep your indexes lean.

This extension defines a Page index for you. Pages will be indexed on title 
and content, with a field boost applied to title. Included attributes are: 
status_id, updated_at, and a +searchable+ boolean. You can toggle the 
searchable attribute from within the page edit view if you wish to restrict
certain pages from appearing in the results -- just remember to call
Page.search with +:conditions => { :searchable => 1 }+ if that's the case.
